# Promises AppliedÂ 

A theoritical and practical approach to understanding JavaScript Promises.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the Promises Course course on Udacity.

## Context

JavaScript is an asynchronous programming language, and if you want want to avoid callback hell you will have to learn to use Promises.

Promises provide a simpler alternative for executing, composing, and managing asynchronous operations when compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They also allow you to handle asynchronous errors using approaches that are similar to synchronous try/catch.
