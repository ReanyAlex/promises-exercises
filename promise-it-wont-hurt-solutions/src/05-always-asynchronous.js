/*
In this lesson, we are going to prove to ourselves that promises are always
asynchronous.

First, create a promise using the Promise constructor.

In the promise’s executor, immediately fulfill the promise with a value of
'PROMISE VALUE'.

After the creation of the promise, pass console.log as the success handler to
the promise.

Finally, print out “MAIN PROGRAM” with console.log.

## Hints

If the execution of promise is synchronous, the value of the promise is already
known after its construction. The console.log passed into then would then
be executed as soon as the then is called.

However, if your script is successful, you should see “MAIN PROGRAM” before
“PROMISE VALUE”.

This shows you that despite the promise being resolved synchronously, the
provided function is not executed until the next turn of the event loop.
*/

var promise = new Promise(function(fulfill, reject) {
  fulfill('PROMISE VALUE')
});
//resolved second because the system needs to wait for the event loop
promise.then(console.log);
//resolved first
console.log('MAIN PROGRAM');
